# IT2901 Lånekassen

This project was completed as part of the IT2901 Informatics Project II course at NTNU.

This software is developed for the Norwegian State Educational Loan Fund (Lånekassen). It allows employees to register their absence, indicating whether they are absent but available remote, unavailable, or on-leave. The goal is to provide a system that enables all employees to easily track each other's availability status. 

Installation guides for the frontend and backend can be found at [frontend/README.md](frontend/README.md) and [backend/README.md](backend/README.md) respectively.
